        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p>To be honest, I absolutely don't have any possibly useful
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>The only thing I've been happily paid to do in last decade,
            is to design and build large complicated and resource
            consuming software, that runs on expensive and faulty
            hardware, to fulfill simple and cheap tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Good and not good at</h2>
        <p>My experience is mostly around Java. I have some experience
            on C/C++, Python, PERL, Ruby, DHTML and Javascript
            programming and I'm happy to continue to learn these
            programming languages, more than happy to get paid for it.
            However hiring me for non-Java software development is like
            getting on an airplane to have peanuts.
