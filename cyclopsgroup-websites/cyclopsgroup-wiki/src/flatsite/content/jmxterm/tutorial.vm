The downloaded UBER jar runs out of box with java
-jar command. Yes, there's no dependency, installation, user
configuration, file structure, permission or log directory to setup.


Just Download And Run
<code>java -jar jmxterm-&lt;version&gt;-uber.jar</code>
without any option opens an interactive command line console where
commands are self-explained. You will never get lost.

##<![CDATA[
  jiaqi@happycow:~$ java -jar jmxterm-1.0-alpha-3-uber.jar
  Welcome to JMX terminal. Type "help" for available commands.
  ?$
##]]>

Once you are in the console, help command shows all available commands
and help with command name or command with -h option shows the usage of
each command. For example

##<![CDATA[
  > help get
  usage: get [-b <val>] [-d <val>] [-h] [-i] [-q] [-s]
  Get value of MBean attribute(s)
  -b,--bean <val> MBean name where the attribute is. Optional if bean has
  been set
  -d,--domain <val> Domain of bean, optional
  -h,--help Display usage
  -i,--info Show detail information of each attribute
  -q,--quots Quotation marks around value
  -s,--simple Print simple expression of value without full expression
  * stands for all attributes. eg. get Attribute1 Attribute2 or get *
