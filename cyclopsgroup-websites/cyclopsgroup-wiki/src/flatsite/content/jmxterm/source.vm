==Build with Maven

Jmxterm project is built with Maven so there isn't a Makefile or
build.xml in source repository. To build artifacts from source code,
make sure Maven is installed on your computer and run following
commands:

##<![CDATA[
  mvn clean package # Clean up workplace and build new artifact
##]]>

If you are unfamiliar with Maven, Maven is a very powerful tool that
builds, releases and generates various of documentation and reports from
a central configuration. Try following commands and see what happens:

##<![CDATA[
  mvn site #Build all targets and generate project website
##]]>

==Build RPM package

Codehaus Mojos released a
[http://mojo.codehaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin|Maven RPM plugin] for RPM
generation, which is really cool and solves one of the open questions
perfectly. With this plugin, RPM package can be easily generated from
source code with maven command:

##<![CDATA[
  mvn rpm:rpm
##]]>

The Maven RPM plugin was added recently so I haven't released RPM
artifact in sourceforge download page. In next release of Jmxterm, there
will be a downloadable RPM file. Until then, you need to build from
source if you want RPM file.

DEB build is on the way but not ready yet,
unfortunately.
