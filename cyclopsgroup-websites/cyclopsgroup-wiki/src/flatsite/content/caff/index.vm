CAFF is
Conversion and Formatting Framework library for Java. It allows
developer to specify characters conversion and formatting code logics in
annotations and simple API.

The conversion framework covers normal
character - object conversion for primitive and most usual objects, and
it allows to create customized rule and define customized annotations,
with which the simple generic conversion API knows how to convert based
upon customized conversion rules.

The formatting framework focuses on
several common text format such as CSV, fix-length and delimiter based
syntax. With predefined annotations, combined with customized conversion
annotations, arbitrary Java bean can be easily formatted to or parsed
from characters such as Reader/Writer or CharSequence.
