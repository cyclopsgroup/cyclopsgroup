        <section name="Based on Tornado Framework">
            <p>Based on tornado, HealthFarm doesn't need to care about security, navigator or the deployment process. The developer merely follow the instructions and focus on business logic. What need to program is business logic layer(in form of ObjectBroker) and presentation layer(Screen and Action). The database layer objects are generated by <a href="http://db.apache.org/torque">Torque</a>, so what the developer need to do is create the database schema in form of Apache database schema XML, and also define the data inform of XML. These descriptor files can be found at src/schema in the source code distribution.</p>
