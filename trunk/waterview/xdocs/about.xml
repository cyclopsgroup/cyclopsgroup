			<p>Waterview pwky is a road in north dallas, TX. Every morning I drive through that road with my wife. When it was time to name this project, waterview was the first thing came to my mind.</p>
			<p>The interesting thing is, waterview is also the name of a notorious apartment provider located beside the waterview pkwy. People living there are mostly students in University of Texas at Dallas. The quality of this community is so bad that these residents even create a website (<a href="http://www.waterviewsux.com">waterviewsux.com</a>) to discuss issues with their quality of life on campus. Therefore, waterviewsux.com is talking about the apartment provider instead of the waterview pkwy.</p>
