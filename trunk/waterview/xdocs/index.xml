			<p>Yet another portal system? No, even worse. It's not even JSP-168 compliant.</p>
			<p>Waterview is another java web application framework with a portal-system-like design. In waterview, a visible page under a given URL is split into the following conceptions: Page, Layout, Panel(s) and View(s). Once the environment is built, developers can focus on only the View part.</p>
			<p>Waterview is under active development now. Any suggestion is welcom. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:jiaqi.guo@gmail.com">shoot me email</a> with your idea.</p>

		<section name="Waterview vs. Turbine">
			<p>Componentization and avalon standard is the difference between waterview and turbine 3.</p>
			<p>The pattern of waterview is borrowed from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine">turbine </a> while the implementation makes huge difference. Both turbine and waterview is introducing a pluggable web application but waterview makes the way of configuring pipeline valves, error handler, page renderers and other components (services in turbine) unified and generic. In waterview, all these elements are components defined in xml file for plexus container. </p>
			<p>Basically the intention of waterview is to make turbine more componentized and unified,  eliminate the pipeline specific definition (pipeline xml), turbine specific configuration (TurbineResources.properties) and introduce avalon.</p>

		<section name="Waterview vs. Summit">
			<p>Well, one difference is waterview is called waterview and summit is called summit.</p>
			<p>I would like to delete waterview directory from my CVS server if summit project is under active development today. Actaully several small projects in my list used to be based on summit. However, we can not even find this project any longer now.</p>
