 # Common Public License - v 1.0
 #
 #
 # THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 #  COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
 # DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF
 # THIS AGREEMENT.
 #
 #
 # 1. DEFINITIONS
 #
 # "Contribution" means:
 #
 # a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
 #  Agreement, and
 # b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 # i) changes to the Program, and
 # ii) additions to the Program;
 # where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that
 # particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
 # Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions
 # do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
 # conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works
 # of the Program.
 #
 # "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 #
 #
 # "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily
 # infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
 #
 #
 # "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
 #
 #
 # "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
 # Contributors.
 #
 #
 # 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 #
 # a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
 # non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
 # publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
 # if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 # b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
 #  non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
 # offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source
 # code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution
 #  and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
 # Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
 #  shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
 # licensed hereunder.
 # c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
 # forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
 # patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
 # liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
 # property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
 # each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
 # needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
 #  distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
 # the Program.
 # d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
 # Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 # 3. REQUIREMENTS
 #
 # A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license
 # agreement, provided that:
 #
 # a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 # b) its license agreement:
 # i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
 #  implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
 # or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
 # ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
 # indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 # iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
 # alone and not by any other party; and
 # iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
 # licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
 # software exchange.
 # When the Program is made available in source code form:
 #
 # a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 # b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 #
 # Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
 #
 #
 # Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
 # reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 #
 #
 # 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 #
 # Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
 # business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the
 # Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do
 # so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
 # Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
 #  ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
 #  ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
 # from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 # Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
 #  in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
 # obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
 # intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
 # promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
 # Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the
 # defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
 # any such claim at its own expense.
 #
 #
 # For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product
 # X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
 #  performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
 #  warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 # Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
 # those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
 #  damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 #
 #
 # 5. NO WARRANTY
 #
 # EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
 # PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
 # KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
 # WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
 # OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
 # determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
 # associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks
 # and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
 # or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 #
 #
 # 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 #
 # EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
 #  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 #  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
 # WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
 # OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
 #  NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
 # DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
 #  HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 #
 #
 # 7. GENERAL
 #
 # If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
 # affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without
 # further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 # necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 #
 #
 # If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
 # software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted
 # by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such
 # litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 # cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations
 #  of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
 # Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 #
 #
 # All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
 # material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
 # period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
 #  Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 # reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
 # granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 #
 #
 # Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
 # inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner.
 #  The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
 # Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify
 # this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
 # as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
 # given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 # distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after
 # a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
 #  (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a)
 # and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
 # Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
 # rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 #
 #
 # This  Agreement is  governed by  the laws   of the  State of  New York  and  the
 # intellectual property laws  of the United  States of America.  No party to  this
 # Agreement will  bring a  legal action  under this  Agreement more  than one year
 # after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
 # any resulting litigation.
