        <section name="Turbine">
            <p>Apache Jakarta Turbine is the foundation of Tornado Platform. The development tornado project is canonically followed the rules of Turbine framework. All the pages and actions are based on Turbine Screen and Action, and most components are implemented as Turbine Servics.</p>
            <p>About why Turbine instead of Struts, there are a lot of articles in internet. Just take a lot at Turbine project, you will find the reason.</p>

        <section name="Maven">
            <p>All projects in Cyclops Group Alliance are built by maven. Apache Maven is somehow like Ant, but not only a build tool. </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Plexus">
            <p>In the future, I will change the base of tornado from Turbine into Plexus. But since the first stable version of plexus is still under development, I haven't done anything for it yet.</p>
