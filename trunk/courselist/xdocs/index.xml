                The collegiate world demands a reliable, easy method that allows students and administrators alike to
                control college courses. The “CourseList” project aims to do exactly this. Software allows this
                otherwise messy task to be automated and simplified.
            </p>
            <p>
                CourseList will be accessible both by students and by administrators. Each type of user has his/her own
                set of capabilities. Students will be able to search through courses, looking up course descriptions,
                and adding or dropping classes. Administrators will have the ability to create, edit, or delete courses,
                as well as gather information regarding their students. Specifically, CourseList breaks down into the
                following modules:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Course Management (by sysadmin)
                        <ul>
                            <li>List, search, delete, or create courses</li>
                            <li>Change existing course</li>
                            <li>Set course prerequisites/co-requisites</li>
                            <li>Change course dependency</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Student Management (by sysadmin)
                        <ul>
                            <li>List, search, delete, or create students</li>
                            <li>Change student details, password</li>
                            <li>Force student to register/drop courses</li>
                            <li>Override a prerequisite requirement (with special permission)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Student Workbench (by student)
                        <ul>
                            <li>List, search courses</li>
                            <li>
                                Register or drop a course (based on course dependency; the student may not be able to
                                see all available courses for him to register)
                            </li>
                            <li>See student’s own information and related courses</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As the project develops, additional features may be added, such as transcript requests, degree audits,
                or contact capabilities.
