            <p>Before doing this you should well understand what is MAVEN and how MAVEN works. These documents can be found at <a href="http://maven.apache.org">http://maven.apache.org</a>.</p>
            <p>Make sure all the jars your project depends can be found at ibiblio.org or other remote jar repository. If they can not, an addistional jar repository should be built.</p>
            <p>Then what you need to do is edit the descriptor files ---- project.xml and project.properties, and sometimes you need to reorganize the files in the project.</p>

        <subsection name="How to start a new project?">
            <p>Use your favorite IDE software to create a new project. Remember to put the source files into the folders where MAVEN suggests.</p>
            <p>Create descriptor files----project.xml and project.properties. The easiest way is copying them from another project, and change it.</p>
