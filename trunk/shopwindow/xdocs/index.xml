            <p>Software is supposed to make things simple, not complicated. However, the fact is in many cases it doesn't, on purpose. Our goal is making software not profound and powerful, but simple, generic and easy to understand.</p>
            <p>Initially, we focus on solutions for common questions like application frameworks, database tools and mathematics problems.</p>
