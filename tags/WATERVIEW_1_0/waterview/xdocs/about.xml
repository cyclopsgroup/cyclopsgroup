			<p>Waterview Dr. is a road in north dallas, TX. Every morning I went through this drive with my wife. When it was time to name this project, waterview was the first thing came to my mind.</p>
			<p>The interesting thing is, waterview is also the name of a notorious apartment provider located beside the waterview dr. People living there are mostly students in University of Texas at Dallas. The quality of this community is so bad that these residents even create a website (<a href="http://www.waterviewsux.com">waterviewsux.com</a>) to discuss issues with their quality of life on campus.</p>
